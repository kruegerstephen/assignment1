Hey

My name is Steve and I'm originally from Philadelphia. I just spent the last 6 months working for Panera in Boston, programming their mobile-website. I loved it so much that I decided to focus on it, so I'm really excited to learn how to build a website from the start. 

I'm really into film. My favorite Directors are probably Lynch and Tarkovsky. 

I come from huge family; my extended family is over 90 people.
