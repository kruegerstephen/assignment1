Hey

My name is Steve and I'm originally from Philadelphia. I just spent the last 6 months working for Panera in Boston, programming their mobile website. 

When I'm home, I go Backpacking multiple times a month in the summer. 

I love music. I generally listen to folk, hip hop, and electronic music. 

I'm really into film. My favorite Directors are probably Lynch and Tarkovsky. 

I come from a huge family; my extended family is over 90 people. 

I spent my Spring Break, in Canada. We went from Philadelphia to Quebec, Montreal, and ended up in Toronto.
