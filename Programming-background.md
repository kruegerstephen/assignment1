Programming background

Like I mentioned in my non-programming bio, I worked for Panera for 6 months. In this time I learned a lot about website management, and my big project for them was to develop their testing automation framework using Selenium. 
I have also built and maintained a database using sql for my databases class. 

That is by far the most impressive code-related thing on my resume. 
I took a writing for the web class where we were tasked with making our own website. I had built and maintained a website blog for a few months.
